# Useful apps

This is just a personal list of tools I might not use very often, but is good to have them.

- [Flow Charts](#flow-charts)
- [Hex Editors](#hex-editors)
- [Other apps for macOS](#other-apps-for-macos)
- [Analysing Projects](#analysing-projects)
- [Free Privacy Focused Analytics](#free-privacy-focused-analytics)


## Flow Charts

- [js2flowchart.js](https://github.com/Bogdan-Lyashenko/js-code-to-svg-flowchart) - SVG charts from JavaScript code. More like a visual representation of the code than a flowchart.
    - Live: https://github.com/Bogdan-Lyashenko/js-code-to-svg-flowchart
- [code2flow](https://code2flow.com) - My favourite so far, DSL is easy and offers most of what you need in a flow chart diagram. Online service, 5 diagrams w/ 50 nodes are free.


## Hex Editors

- [HexEd.it](https://hexed.it/) - Online Hex editor, with a lot of good features, impressive online app.
- [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) (Windows) - Probably the best Hex editor on Windows.
- [HexEdit](https://github.com/strobejb/HexEdit) (Windows) - Open source hex editor, last update 2015.
- [Hex Fiend](https://hexfiend.com) (macOS) - Probably the best free Hex editor on macOS, often cloned in random App store apps.
- [rehex](https://github.com/solemnwarning/rehex) (Linux) - Reverse Engineers' Hex Editor


## Other apps for macOS

- For much better mouse acceleration install this preferences pane: http://triq.net/mac/mouse-acceleration
- For keeping natural scrolling on track pad and normal scrolling on mouse: https://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/
    - This application will be a pay-app in the future
- For reversing scrolls this looks like another option (haven't tried it): https://github.com/ther0n/UnnaturalScrollWheels
